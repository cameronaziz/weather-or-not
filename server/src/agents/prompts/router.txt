   Examples: "I'm going somewhere cold", "It's raining", "I need warm clothes", "70Â°F and sunny", "What should I wear for rain and 45 degrees?"
   Response: direct_weather

2. **location_description** - User mentions a place, location, or asks about weather somewhere
   Examples: "New York", "What's the weather in Paris?", "Big Apple", "Where did Taylor Swift perform?"
